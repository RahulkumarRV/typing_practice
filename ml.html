<h1>What is machine learning?</h1><ol><li>"ML" stands for "Machine Learning." It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform a specific task without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning allows computers to learn and improve from experience.</li><li>The key idea behind machine learning is to develop algorithms that can analyze and interpret data, identify patterns, and make intelligent decisions. Instead of relying on explicit programming instructions, machine learning algorithms learn from data and adjust their behavior over time.</li></ol>
